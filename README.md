# Expense Tracking and Budget Alert Platform

## Overview

The Expense Tracking and Budget Alert Platform is a web application that helps users track their spending and receive timely budget notifications. By leveraging the Plaid API for secure transaction fetching and Next.js for optimal performance, the platform provides a seamless expense monitoring experience.

### Problem

Many people struggle to maintain consistent awareness of their spending habits and often exceed their budgets without realizing it until it's too late. Traditional banking apps typically show transactions after the fact, and manual expense tracking is time-consuming and prone to errors. There's a need for an automated solution that provides real-time insights and proactive notifications about spending patterns.
